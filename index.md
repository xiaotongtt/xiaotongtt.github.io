## About Me

I'm currently a fourth year PhD student at the Xiamen University, supervised by Prof. [Yanyun Qu](https://quyanyun.xmu.edu.cn/chinese/sy.htm). 
I received my M.Eng degree from Xiamen University in 2020, supervised by Prof. [Cuihua Li](). 
Before that, I received the B.Eng degree from the Department of Electronic Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University in 2017.

My research interests include but are not limited to: low-level vision, image super-resolution, dehazing and image generation.

Now I am looking for a teaching and research position.
